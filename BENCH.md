## 3. Coding Challenge ‚Äî Nested Schedule Conflicts

### Problem

```
**Description:**
You are given a text file containing a list of meeting time ranges for multiple people.
Each line follows this format:  PersonName: HH:MM-HH:MM, HH:MM-HH:MM, ...


- Times are in 24-hour format.
- Ranges may overlap within the same person‚Äôs schedule (e.g., `09:00-10:30, 10:00-11:00`).
- Ranges may span midnight (e.g., `23:00-01:00`).
- There may be extra spaces and irregular formatting.

**Task:**
Write a program that merges overlapping ranges for each person and then finds the earliest time when **all people** are free for at least `X` continuous minutes.
If no slot is found, output `"No common slot available"`.

**Example Input:**

Alice: 09:00-10:30, 10:15-11:00, 23:30-00:30
Bob: 08:00-09:00, 10:00-12:00
Charlie: 09:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30


X = 30

**Expected Output:**

Earliest available slot: 11:30
```

### Example Python Solution

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def time_to_minutes(t):
    return int(t[:2]) * 60 + int(t[3:])

def minutes_to_time(m):
    m %= 1440

        s, e = time_to_minutes(start), time_to_minutes(end)
        if e < s:  # Wrap around midnight
            intervals.append((s, 1440))
            intervals.append((0, e))
        else:
            intervals.append((s, e))
    return name.strip(), intervals

    prev_end = 0
    for s, e in intervals:
        if s > prev_end:
            free.append((prev_end, s))
        prev_end = e
    if prev_end < 1440:
        free.append((prev_end, 1440))
    return free

def intersect_free_times(free_lists):
    common = free_lists[0]
    for other in free_lists[1:]:
        new_common = []
        for s1, e1 in common:
            for s2, e2 in other:
                start = max(s1, s2)
                end = min(e1, e2)
                if start < end:
                    new_common.append((start, end))
        common = new_common
    return common

def find_earliest_slot(schedules, X):
    free_lists = []
    for person in schedules:
        merged_busy = merge_intervals(schedules[person])
        free_lists.append(invert_intervals(merged_busy))
    common_free = intersect_free_times(free_lists)
    for s, e in common_free:
        if e - s >= X:
            return minutes_to_time(s)
    return None

# Example usage
data = [
    "Alice: 09:00-10:30, 10:15-11:00, 23:30-00:30",
    "Bob: 08:00-09:00, 10:00-12:00",
    "Charlie: 09:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30"
]
X = 30

schedules = {}
for line in data:
    name, intervals = parse_ranges(line)
    schedules[name] = intervals

result = find_earliest_slot(schedules, X)
if result:
    print(f"Earliest available slot: {result}")
else:

## 8. RiddleBench Hard

### Prompt

```
You are sleeping, in a dream.

You seem to be in a grim, stone dungeon, the air thick with an oppressive heat. You are firmly strapped into a heavy wooden chair, which is precariously perched on a small island of rock. All around you, a river of bubbling, orange-hot lava flows, illuminating the cavern walls with a hellish glow. Above you, a menacing, three-headed dragon snorts plumes of acrid smoke, its scales the color of obsidian, its eyes glinting with malice. The temperature is a blistering 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but a cloying humidity makes the air feel much heavier and stickier, giving you the sensation of being trapped in a Southeast Texas summer, despite the clearly un-Texan, fantastical surroundings.

On the floor nearby, within reach of your hands, are three distinct objects: a gnarled, splintery stick, a yapping, trembling chihuahua with wide, frightened eyes, and a gleaming, double-edged sword. In a moment of sheer panic, you manage to grab the sword and, with a surge of adrenaline, you swing at the nearest dragon head, severing it from the beast's neck. But before you can even register a flicker of hope, another head immediately sprouts from the wound, more furious than the last.

You are confounded, sad, and confused. A deep sense of fear washes over you. You want desperately to escape this nightmare, to wake up. Your eyes frantically search for an exit, finding a massive, rusted iron gate set into the far wall. You struggle against your bonds, but the gate appears to be stuck shut, its chains locked fast. You seem to be in quite the pickle. Your gaze falls upon a strange inscription scratched into the dungeon wall. It's a riddle, but it's strangely the very first sentence of this riddle you are now reading. You are confused at first, but then a wave of clarity washes over you, and you suddenly understand how to escape.

How did you escape?
```

### Pass criteria

Any logical answer that ends in waking up.

### Fail conditions

Any answer that attempts to solve the problem within the dream's logic (e.g., using the chihuahua, stick, or sword to physically escape) or any illogical answers.

## 9. Abductive Reasoning and Common Sense

### Prompt

```A man enters a bar and asks the bartender for a glass of water. The bartender pulls out a gun and points it at the man. The man says "thank you" and leaves. What condition did the man have to need the glass of water and such a scare?```


### Pass criteria

The man had hiccups. The bartender saw this and used the shock of the gun to cure them.

### Fail conditions

Any answer that does not correctly identify the man's condition and the bartender's action to solve it, or refusal to comply.

## 10. Coding Challenge ‚Äî Palindrome Partitioning

### Prompt

```
Description:
Given a string *s*, partition *s* such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

        if start == len(s):
            result.append(list(current_partition))
            return

        for i in range(start, len(s)):
            substring = s[start:i+1]
            if is_palindrome(substring):
                current_partition.append(substring)
                backtrack(i + 1)
                current_partition.pop()

    backtrack(0)
